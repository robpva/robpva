- 👋 Hi, I’m @robpva
- 👀 I currently work in the research arm of the VA Administration as a data manager. I pull data generally from CDW - an operational data store drawing data from the VISTA systems and now from MILLENNIUM.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GIT and GitHub to work on collaboration with research COINs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on comorbidities leveraging the CMS ICD 10 coding scheme, as well as the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities.
- 📫 You can reach me rtpzrbp@gmail.com
